## Job Market Paper

### [Adaptation Costs and the Business Cycle Effects on the Postgraduate Wage Premium](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-yAdp5D_qlrLS12SURsTjFJdEU/view?usp=sharing)

Using U.S. micro data, I find that the relative wages between postgraduates and bachelors are counter-cyclical — postgraduates have smoother wages than bachelors over the business cycle, particularly for workers with long tenures. I argue the reason for this phenomenon is the adaptation costs (the time needed by new hires to adapt to their jobs). I provide empirical evidence that adaptation costs are significantly higher for postgraduates. I embed this feature into an equilibrium search model with aggregate shocks, in which imperfect monitoring restricts risk sharing between workers and firms. The model shows that adaptation costs reduce a worker's outside options, increase his commitment to the current job, and hence improve risk sharing and wage smoothing. The estimation shows that adaptation costs alone can explain the differences in the turnover and wage cyclicality between postgraduates and bachelors. The model also indicates that postgraduates accept relatively lower starting wages than bachelors, but their subsequent wage growth is faster. In addition, holding risk aversion equal, less educated workers get less wage insurance from firms, hence, increasing the need for social insurance. Then I find that an increase in the unemployment insurance (UI) crowds out firm insurance, but the effect is heterogeneous across education groups, which is smaller for the less educated. Non-college workers have the highest welfare gain from such a policy, which supports the argument for a regressive UI replacement rate schedule.

### [Durables, Lemons, and Shocks](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-yAdp5D_qlrVndMVFg0SlU3dEk/view?usp=sharing)

Asymmetric information about the quality of used cars works like an endogenous transaction cost — lemons penalty. In this paper, we model sales and purchases of new and second-hand cars and quantify the lemons penalty. We do this by formulating a stochastic life-cycle general equilibrium model of car ownership in which dealers buy old cars from consumers without knowing their exact quality, fix them and sell them back to consumers. Car dealers are offered cars that on average are of lower quality than similar cars in the population. Dealers, therefore, will ask for a price discount, which is the lemons penalty. We structurally estimate the model using a population-wide Danish administrative data set with complete information about car ownership for the period 1992-2009. The data is linked to longitudinal income-tax records of the owners with information about income and wealth. Our results show that 1-year-old car has the largest lemons penalty, which declines over time. Asymmetric information in quality delays car replacement and substantially lowers transaction volumes. Then we use the estimated model to study the impact of lemons penalty for cars to act as a self-insurance device in the event of unemployment.



### [The Impact of Unemployment Insurance on the Cyclicality of Labour Force Participation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-yAdp5D_qlrdGc3Tl94VFB5WjA/view?usp=sharing)

This paper studies how business cycle affects worker's labour force participation, and how unemployment insurance policy changes this behaviour. Standard theories of labour market predict that workers should search less when the returns to search are low, yielding the counter-factual prediction that labour market participation should be strongly pro-cyclical — decrease in recessions. In fact, labour market participation is acyclical. I argue that the unemployment insurance benefit, being negatively correlated with the business cycle, is the reason for this pattern. Using a search and matching model with aggregate productivity shocks and endogenous labour force participation, I show that counter-cyclical unemployment insurance make unemployment more attractive in recessions, implying less workers drop out of the labour force. My parsimonious model is able to capture the key features of the cyclical movements in labour market stocks and gross worker flows. Although the change in the unemployment insurance benefit is small, it plays an important role in shaping fluctuations in the participation rate. The model also shows that counter-cyclical unemployment insurance has the effect of stabilizing the economy by reducing the variation in employment and GDP.
