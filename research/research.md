## Job Market Paper

### [Adaptation Costs and the Business Cycle Effects on the Postgraduate Wage Premium](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-yAdp5D_qlrLS12SURsTjFJdEU/view?usp=sharing)

Using U.S. micro data, I find that the relative wages between postgraduates and bachelors are counter-cyclical — postgraduates have smoother wages than bachelors over the business cycle, particularly for workers with long tenures. I argue the reason for this phenomenon is the adaptation costs due to the relatively low productivity of new hires. Empirical statistics show that job adaptation takes significantly longer for postgraduates. Using an equilibrium search model with aggregate shocks, in which imperfect monitoring restricts risk sharing between workers and firms, I show adaptation costs reduce worker's outside options, increase his commitment in the match, and hence improve risk sharing. The model shows that adaptation costs alone can explain the differences in the turnover and wage cyclicality between postgraduates and bachelors. The model also shows that postgraduates accept relatively lower starting wages, but the subsequent wage growth is faster. On the other hand, holding risk aversion equal, less educated workers get less wage insurance from firms, hence, increasing the need for social insurance. Then I show that an increase in the unemployment insurance has heterogeneous effects across education groups: it crowds out firm insurance, but less for the low-educated. Non-college workers, who have the least firm insurance, have the highest welfare gain from such a policy.


## Working Papers

### [Durables, Lemons, and Shocks](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-yAdp5D_qlrVndMVFg0SlU3dEk/view?usp=sharing)

This paper addresses the question of how workers insure themselves against earnings shocks using durable goods. Asymmetric information about the quality of used cars works like a transaction cost, and it implies that used cars are a poor savings vehicle. In this paper we model sales and purchases of new and second hand cars and quantify the lemons premium. We do this by formulating a stochastic life cycle general equilibrium model of car ownership in which dealers buy old cars from consumers without knowing their exact quality, fix them and sell them back to consumers. Car dealers are offered cars that on average are of lower quality than similar cars in the population. Consumers selling above-average quality cars therefore receive a lower payment than what they would have if there was no informational asymmetry, and this difference is the lemons penalty. The supply of cars into the used car market varies as households receive news about their income and this affect the average quality of cars entering the secondary market. This mechanism enables us to study how equilibrium prices and the flow of cars in and out of the market are characterized. We calibrate the model using a population-wide high quality administrative data set with complete information about car ownership for the period 1992-2009. The data is linked to longitudinal income-tax records of the owners with information about income and wealth. We structurally estimate the model and use it to quantify the lemons premium by comparing the observed market outcome with the counter-factual outcomes under symmetric information. Our results show that the lemons premium reduces the transaction volume drastically. We then use the estimated model to study how workers use used cars to deal with unemployment and earnings shocks.



### [The Impact of Unemployment Insurance on the Cyclicality of Labour Force Participation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-yAdp5D_qlrdGc3Tl94VFB5WjA/view?usp=sharing)

This paper studies how business cycle affects worker's labour force participation, and how unemployment insurance policy changes this behaviour. Standard theories of labour market predict that workers should search less when the returns to search are low, yielding the counter-factual prediction that labour market participation should be strongly pro-cyclical — decrease in recessions. In fact, labour market participation is acyclical. I argue that the unemployment insurance benefit, being negatively correlated with the business cycle, is the reason for this pattern. Using a search and matching model with aggregate productivity shocks and endogenous labour force participation, I show that counter-cyclical unemployment insurance make unemployment more attractive in recessions, implying less workers drop out of the labour force. My parsimonious model is able to capture the key features of the cyclical movements in labour market stocks and gross worker flows. Although the change in the unemployment insurance benefit is small, it plays an important role in shaping fluctuations in the participation rate. The model also shows that counter-cyclical unemployment insurance has the effect of stabilizing the economy by reducing the variation in employment and GDP.
