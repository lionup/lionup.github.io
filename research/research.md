Postgraduate degree holders experience lower cyclical variation in real wages than those with undergraduate degrees. Moreover, postgraduate jobs require more specific human capital and take longer to adapt to. Using an equilibrium search model with dynamic incentive contracts, this paper attributes the cyclicality of the postgraduate-undergraduate wage gap to the differences in specific capital. Greater specific capital leads to lower mobility, thereby improving risk-sharing between workers and firms. The estimates of the model reveal that specific capital can explain the differences both in labour turnover and in real wage cyclicality between education groups.
 
    
    

### 2. [Durables and Lemons: Private Information and the Market for Cars](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-yAdp5D_qlrVndMVFg0SlU3dEk/view?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}, with Richard Blundell, Hamish Low, Soren Leth-Petersen, and Costas Meghir, **New version July 2020!**, [NBER Working Paper w26281](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26281){target="_blank"}

**Media Coverage**: [_The Economist_](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/09/26/can-you-buy-a-good-second-hand-car){target="_blank"}, [_NEP-DGE blog_](https://nepdge.wordpress.com/2019/10/03/durables-and-lemons-private-information-and-the-market-for-cars/#respond){target="_blank"}

We specify an equilibrium model of car ownership with private information where individuals sell and purchase new and second-hand cars over their life-cycle. This private information introduces a transaction cost, distorts the market and reduces the value of a car as a savings instrument. We estimate the model using Danish linked registry data on car ownership, income and wealth. The transaction cost, which we term the lemons penalty, is estimated to be 18\% of the price in the first year of ownership, declining with the length of ownership. It leads to large reductions in the turnover of cars and in the probability of downgrading at job loss. The size of the lemons penalty decreases when other uncertainty in the economy increases, for example during recessions: negative income shocks induce individuals to sell their cars for consumption smoothing purposes rather than because of low quality.

    
## Work in Progress

### 1. Risk Attitude and Portfolio Choice: An Intra-household Perspective, with Cameron Peng and Weilong Zhang, **Draft coming soon!**

Using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) data, we document that the households whose financial decision-makers are husbands are more attached to the financial market than those whose decision-makers are wives. To explain this fact, we develop a simple intra-household bargaining model of household portfolio choice, in which the couple first collectively decides the household risk preference, which, in turn, determines their portfolio allocations. The bargaining power of each spouse depends on a wide range of economic and non-economic characteristics. Our channel decomposition analysis shows the risk related variables (income, education, cognitive ability and financial literacy) are most important factors in explaining the gender asymmetric associations between the bargaining power and household investment decisions. Incorporating "Big-five" personality traits in the bargaining equation reduces the household risk taking preference and therefore leads to the decrease of stock market participation rates, which is opposite to the effect of gender identify norm. 


### 2. Cyclical Employment Exits and Unemployment Insurance, with Similan Rujiwattanapong

We develop an equilibrium search model with endogenous labour force participation and countercyclical unemployment insurance (UI). Workers optimally search for jobs and their search intensity increases with the return from searching. Despite negative aggregate shocks, countercyclical UI provides incentive to search on the extensive margin during recessions. We use the model to explain the cyclical properties of the transition rate from employment to out-of-labour-force (E2O). As in the US data, the model predicts that E2O is procyclical. This property is in sharp contrast to the prediction of the standard search theory without countercyclical UI that the labour force participation should increase in booms. We also find that the role of reverse added worker effect on the E2O transitions is relatively limited.
