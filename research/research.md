### [Specific Skills and the Business Cycle Effects on the Postgraduate Wage Premium]("https://www.dropbox.com/s/dh4i6n7q0mw63ca/RanPaper.pdf?dl=0")

This paper studies the business cycle effect on the postgraduate wage premium. Using US. micro data, I show this wage premium is counter-cyclical — the postgraduate wage is smoother than the bachelor wage over the cycle. I argue that specific skill is the reason for this pattern. Empirical statistics show that postgraduates have longer training duration and higher displacement costs, indicating higher specific skills. Using a contracting model featured with training, asymmetric information, and aggregate shocks, I show specific skills reduce workers’ outside options, increase their commitment in the match, and allow firms to better insure them against aggregate shocks. The model shows that specific skills alone can explain the differences in the turnovers and wage cyclicality between postgraduates and bachelors. The model also shows that postgraduates accept relatively lower starting wages, but the subsequent wage growth is faster. On the other hand, non-college workers are more risk-averse, so they select into contracts with smoother wages. Once holding risk aversion equal, less educated workers get less wage insurance from firms. I also show that an increase in the unemployment insurance crowds out firm insurance, particularly for the postgraduates. Non-college workers have the highest welfare gain from such a policy.

### [Durables, Lemons, and Shocks]("https://www.dropbox.com/s/o7v3pkdu7t0cpnt/RanCar.pdf?dl=0")

joint with R. Blundell, H. Low, S. Leth-Petersen, and C. Meghir

This paper addresses the question of how workers insure themselves against earnings shocks using durable goods. Asymmetric information about the quality of used cars works like a transaction cost, and it implies that used cars are a poor savings vehicle. In this paper we model sales and purchases of new and second hand cars and quantify the lemons premium. We do this by formulating a stochastic life cycle general equilibrium model of car ownership in which dealers buy old cars from consumers without knowing their exact quality, fix them and sell them back to consumers. Car dealers are offered cars that on average are of lower quality than similar cars in the population. Consumers selling above-average quality cars therefore receive a lower payment than what they would have if there was no informational asymmetry, and this difference is the lemons penalty. The supply of cars into the used car market varies as households receive news about their income and this affect the average quality of cars entering the secondary market. This mechanism enables us to study how equilibrium prices and the flow of cars in and out of the market are characterized. We calibrate the model using a population-wide high quality administrative data set with complete information about car ownership for the period 1992-2009. The data is linked to longitudinal income-tax records of the owners with information about income and wealth. We structurally estimate the model and use it to quantify the lemons premium by comparing the observed market outcome with the counter-factual outcomes under symmetric information. Our results show that the lemons premium reduces the transaction volume drastically. We then use the estimated model to study how workers use used cars to deal with unemployment and earnings shocks.



### [The Impact of Unemployment Insurance on the Cyclicality of Labour Force Participation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fwp6ppw1v9v4udx/RanUI.pdf?dl=0)

This paper studies how business cycle affects worker's labour force participation, and how unemployment insurance policy changes this behavior. Standard theories of labour market predict that workers should search less when the returns to search are low, yielding the counter-factual prediction that labour market participation should be strongly pro-cyclical — decrease in recessions. In fact, labour market participation is acyclical. I argue that the unemployment insurance benefit, being negatively correlated with the business cycle, is the reason for this pattern. Using a search and matching model with aggregate productivity shocks and endogenous labour force participation, I show that counter-cyclical unemployment insurance make unemployment more attractive in recessions, implying less workers drop out of the labour force. My parsimonious model is able to capture the key features of the cyclical movements in labour market stocks and gross worker flows. Although the change in the unemployment insurance benefit is small, it plays an important role in shaping fluctuations in the participation rate.
