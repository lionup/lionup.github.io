  * **Abstract**: Postgraduate degree holders experience lower cyclical variation in real wages than those with undergraduate degrees. Moreover, postgraduate jobs require more specific human capital and take longer to adapt to. Using an equilibrium search model with dynamic incentive contracts, this paper attributes the cyclicality of the postgraduate-undergraduate wage gap to the differences in specific capital. Greater specific capital leads to lower mobility, thereby improving risk-sharing between workers and firms. The estimates of the model reveal that specific capital can explain the differences both in labour turnover and in real wage cyclicality between education groups.

### 1. [Durables and Lemons: Private Information and the Market for Cars](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-yAdp5D_qlrVndMVFg0SlU3dEk/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-kGyhQ2_GzUWbiQWrpeH27Q){:target="_blank"}, with Richard Blundell, Hamish Low, Soren Leth-Petersen, and Costas Meghir, **R&R Quantitative Economics**

  * **Media Coverage**: [_The Economist_](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/09/26/can-you-buy-a-good-second-hand-car){:target="_blank"}, [_NEP-DGE blog_](https://nepdge.wordpress.com/2019/10/03/durables-and-lemons-private-information-and-the-market-for-cars/#respond){:target="_blank"}

  * **Abstract**: We quantify the aggregate implications and distributional consequences of asymmetric information, focusing on the car market. Private information introduces a lemons penalty, a wedge between the sale price and average quality in the population. We estimate an equilibrium model of car ownership with private information using Danish linked registry data on car ownership, income and wealth. In the first year of ownership, the lemons penalty is 11% of the price. The penalty declines sharply with the length of ownership. The penalty leads to large reductions in transaction volumes and in the rate of turnover of cars. But the market does not collapse: income shocks induce individuals to sell their cars, even if of good quality, and this limits the lemons problem. The size of the lemons penalty declines when income uncertainty in the economy increases, as happens in recessions.  


### 2. [Effects of Stay-at-home Orders on Skill Requirements in Vacancy Postings](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LF5lhpLsD3hOyJSRvYHh_mDSRIRS78FN/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}, with Ling Zhong, **R&R Labour Economics**

  * **Abstract**: The COVID-19 pandemic and containment policies have had profound economic impacts on the labor market. Stay-at-home orders (SAHOs) implemented across most of the United States changed the way of people worked. In this paper, we quantify the effect of SAHO durations on skill demands to study how firms adjust labor demand within occupation. We use skill requirement information from the 2018 to 2021 online job vacancy posting data from Burning Glass Technologies, exploit the spatial variations in the SAHO duration, and use instrumental variables to correct for the endogeneity in the policy duration related to local social and economic factors. We find that policy durations have persistent impacts on the labor demand after restrictions are lifted. Longer SAHOs motivate management style transformation from people-oriented to operation-oriented by requiring more of operational and administrative skills and less of personality and people management skills to carry out standard workflows. SAHOs also change the focus of interpersonal skill demands from specific customer services to general communication such as social and writing skills. SAHOs more thoroughly affect occupations with partial work-from-home capacity. The evidence suggests SAHOs change management structure and communication in firms.

### 1. [The Gender Gap in Household Bargaining Power: A Portfolio-Choice Approach](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YlS20eus5G7yT3ic9KNrWXPQU1LxN8sT/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}, with Cameron Peng and Weilong Zhang, **Submitted, New version January 2023!**

  * The previous title of this paper is "The Gender Gap in Household Bargaining Power: A Revealed-Preference Approach", [_IFS Working Paper WP21/11_](https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/15437){:target="_blank"}

  * **Abstract**: When members of the same household have different risk preferences, whose preference matters more for investment decisions and why? We propose an intrahousehold model that aggregates individual preferences at the household level as a result of bargaining. We structurally estimate the model, analyze the determinants of bargaining power, and find a significant gender gap. The gap is partially explained by gender differences in individual characteristics such as income and employment, but it is also driven by gender effects. These patterns hold broadly across Australia, Germany, and the US. We further link the distribution of bargaining power to perceived gender norms in the cross-section of households.
