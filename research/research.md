### [Specific Capital, Firm Insurance, and the Dynamics of the Postgraduate Wage Premium](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-yAdp5D_qlrLS12SURsTjFJdEU/view?usp=sharing) (under review)

**Media Coverage**: [_LSE Business Review_](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2018/06/13/a-postgraduate-degree-protects-you-against-the-business-cycle/), [_Royal Economic Society_](http://www.res.org.uk/details/mediabrief/10938521/A-POSTGRADUATE-DEGREE-PROTECTS-YOU-AGAINST-THE-BUSINESS-CYCLE-US-evidence.html)

Postgraduate degree holders experience lower cyclical wage variation than those with undergraduate degrees. Moreover, postgraduates have more specific human capital than undergraduates. Using an equilibrium search model with long-term contracts and imperfect monitoring of worker effort, this paper attributes the cyclicality of the postgraduate-undergraduate wage gap to the differences in specific capital. Imperfect monitoring creates a moral hazard problem that requires firms to pay efficiency wages. More specific capital leads to lower mobility, thereby alleviating the moral hazard and improving risk-sharing. Estimates reveal that specific capital explains the differences both in labour turnover and in wage cyclicality across education groups. 

### [Durables, Lemons, and Shocks](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-yAdp5D_qlrVndMVFg0SlU3dEk/view?usp=sharing)

The second-hand car market is subject to asymmetric information about the quality, which generates an endogenous transaction cost — lemons penalty. In this paper, we model sales and purchases of new and second-hand cars and quantify the lemons penalty. We do this by formulating a stochastic life-cycle general equilibrium model of car ownership in which dealers buy old cars from consumers without knowing their exact quality, fix them and sell them back to consumers. Car dealers are offered cars that on average are of lower quality than similar cars in the population. Dealers, therefore, will not pay the expected value of cars being owned to an offered car. They will ask for a price discount, which is the lemons penalty. We structurally estimate the model using a population-wide Danish administrative data set with complete information about car ownership for the period 1992-2009. The data is linked to longitudinal income-tax records of the owners with information about income and wealth. Our results show that 1-year-old car has the largest lemons penalty, which declines over time. Asymmetric information about the quality delays car replacement and substantially lowers transaction volumes. Then we use the estimated model to study the impact of lemons penalty for cars to act as a self-insurance device in the event of unemployment.



### [Gross Worker Flows over the Business Cycle and the Reverse Added Worker Effect](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-yAdp5D_qlrdGc3Tl94VFB5WjA/view?usp=sharing)

I develop an equilibrium search model with incomplete markets and endogenous labour force participation, where households are formed by a job-seeker and an employed spouse. Households face aggregate shocks on the income of the employed member, but the spouse adjusts her labour supply to insure against the risk. I use the model to explain the cyclical properties of the transition rate from employment to out-of-labour-force (E2O). As in the US data, the model predicts that E2O is strongly pro-cyclical. This property is in sharp contrast to the prediction of the standard search theory that labour force participation should increase in booms. In the two-member household model and in the data, the secondary earner leaves the labour force when the primary earner's income increases. This model also shows that the spouse’s behaviour is affected by the counter-cyclical unemployment benefits, which is in line with the data.
