For computation my preferred tool is the combination of R and C++. Rccp(http://www.rcpp.org/) offers a seamless integration of the two.

I have been involving in the following open source projects:
### [mopt](https://github.com/tlamadon/mopt): Parallel derivative-free moment optimization in R.

### [EconR](http://www.econr.org/index.html): A collection of methods to do economics in R and C++/Fortran.

### [parallelTest](https://github.com/floswald/parallelTest): Repo with tests for parallel computation for a host of hpc systems.
