For computation my preferred tool is the combination of R and C++. R allows high level treatment of the data using the most up to date statistical techniques. C++ allows to carry heavy computation extremely efficiently. Getting the two to talk to each other is made trivial by the excellent package Rccp and al.

I have been involving in the following open source projects
### [mopt](https://github.com/tlamadon/mopt) Parallel derivative-free moment optimization in R.

### [EconR](http://www.econr.org/index.html) A collection of methods to do economics in R and C++/Fortran.

### [parallelTest](https://github.com/floswald/parallelTest) Repo with tests for parallel computation for a host of hpc systems.
