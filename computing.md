My research relies heavily on computational methods. I primarily work with [R](https://www.r-project.org/){:target="_blank"} and [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/){:target="_blank"}, using [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/){:target="_blank"} to integrate the two efficiently. This combination allows me to implement structural models, optimization routines, and simulation-based estimation at scale.  

I have been involved in the following open source projects:

* [mopt](https://github.com/tlamadon/mopt){:target="_blank"}: Parallel derivative-free moment optimization in R.
* [EconR](http://www.econr.org/index.html){:target="_blank"}: A collection of methods to implement economic models in R and C++/Fortran.
* [parallelTest](https://github.com/floswald/parallelTest){:target="_blank"}: Test for parallel computation across different HPC systems.  

<!-- 
For computation I prefer the combination of [R](https://www.r-project.org/){:target="_blank"} and [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/){:target="_blank"}. [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/){:target="_blank"} offers a nice integration of the two.
