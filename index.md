In my [job market paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-yAdp5D_qlrLS12SURsTjFJdEU/view?usp=sharing), I find that workers with postgraduate degrees have smoother wages than those with bachelor degrees over the business cycle, particularly for workers with long tenures. Using an equilibrium search model, I show higher adaptation costs of postgraduates reduce their outside options, increase their commitment to the current job and thus the degree to which firms will offer contracts with smoother wages and greater risk sharing. Also, I show that an increase in the unemployment insurance crowds out firm insurance, but the effect is heterogeneous across education groups, which is smaller for the lower educated.

In my other research papers, (i) we quantify the lemon's problem in the quality of second-hand cars using Danish administrative data and study its implications for transactions and consumption smoothing; and (ii) how the level of unemployment insurance changes labour force participation behaviour over the business cycle.

I will be available for interviews at the 2018 ASSA meeting in Philadelphia, the SAEe meeting in Barcelona and the RES meeting in London.
