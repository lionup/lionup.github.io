In my [job market paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-yAdp5D_qlrLS12SURsTjFJdEU/view?usp=sharing), I find postgraduates have smoother wages than bachelors over the business cycle. Using an equilibrium search model, I show adaptation costs of postgraduates reduce their outside options, increase their commitment in the match, and allow firms to better insure them against aggregate shocks. Furthermore, I show that an increase in the unemployment insurance has heterogeneous effects across education groups: it crowds out firm insurance, but less for the low-educated.

In my other research papers, I examine: (i) how workers insure themselves against earnings shocks using cars that are plagued with asymmetric information about quality; and (ii) how unemployment insurance policy changes labour force participation behaviour over the business cycle.

I will be available for interviews at the 2018 ASSA Meeting in Philadelphia, the SAEe meetings in Barcelona and the RES meetings in London.
